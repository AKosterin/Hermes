## Help! Hermes crashes on startup or behaves badly!

Try resetting all saved state, Preferences, and anything else Hermes related:

2. Remove `~/Library/Application Support/Hermes/`
3. Remove `~/Library/Preferences/com.alexcrichton.Hermes.plist`
4. Remove Hermes from keychain
    1. Open Keychain Access
    2. Search for "Hermes"
